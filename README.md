# Stackdriver exporter

Command line application to extract stackdiver metrics and export then into different formats like prometheus, ....

### Notes

Depends on the following:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
```

```
	// Sets your Google Cloud Platform project ID.
	projectID := "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```


### Still to come

More output formats like CSV, JSON and so on
